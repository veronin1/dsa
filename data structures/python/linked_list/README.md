# LinkedList (Python)

A linked list is a data structure in which each node in the sequence points to the next.

## Interface

The linked list is managed through the following methods:

- `push_back(value)`: Adds the element `value` to the end of the linked list.
- `push_front(value)`: Inserts the element `value` at the beginning of the linked list.
- `print_list()`: Prints the entire linked list from beginning to end.
- `pop_back()`: Removes and returns the last element from the linked list.
- `pop_front()`: Removes and returns the first element from the linked list.
- `front()`: Returns the first element without removing it.
- `back()`: Returns the last element without removing it.
- `empty()`: Returns `True` if the list is empty, otherwise `False`.
- `clear()`: Removes all elements from the linked list, leaving it empty.
- `len()`: Returns the current number of elements in the linked list.
- `remove_value(value)`: Removes the first occurrence of `value` from the linked list.
