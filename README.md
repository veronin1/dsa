# dsa

This repository contains my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in **C++**, **C**, and **Python**.  
It serves as a learning project to practice and understand fundamental concepts in DSA through coding.

## About

I started this repo to:

- Practice key data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- Implement popular algorithms such as sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversals.
- Compare implementations across **C++**, **C**, and **Python** to understand language-specific nuances.
